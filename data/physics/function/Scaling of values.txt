# THIS SHEET IS UPDATED WHENEVER A NEW CALCULATION REQUIRES ME TO DOWNSCALE, OR WHEN A HIGHER SCALE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THE PRECISION IS LOST ANYWAY BECAUSE OF INTERMEDIATE CALCULATIONS
- Position is scaled by 1,000x
- Velocity is scaled by 1,000x and given in blocks/tick
- Acceleration is scaled by 1,000x and given in blocks/tick^2 (Includes gravity and its default value)
- InverseMass is scaled by 100,000,000/x and calculated with in 1/kg
- InverseMassScaled is scaled by 100,000/x and calculated with in 1/kg
- InverseMassScaled2 is scaled by 1,000/x and calculated with in 1/kg
- InverseInertiaTensorLocal is scaled by 1,000,000,000/x (x is a regularly scaled tensor value, like 166 for a cube) (Could reach values like 1,000,000,000/668,333 = 1496, or also 60,000,000)
- InverseInertiaTensorGlobal is scaled by 100,000/x
- Dimension is scaled by 1,000x
- Force is scaled by 1,000x
- Damping is 100x
- Orientation is 1,000x (Values from 0-1)
- RotationMatrix is 1,000x (Important: After a ^2, I need to divide by 1000 to make sure it's not suddenly scaled by 1,000,000)
- AngularVelocity is 1,000x
- Torque is 1,000x
- Coefficients of friction & restitution are 100x

Note: InverseMass of 1,000 is only barely movable by applying 200,000 force (so I can probably scale it down without problems and remove InverseMassScaled. BUT I'LL WAIT UNTIL I'M DONE, THEN I CAN STILL SCALE IT IF I WANT)
